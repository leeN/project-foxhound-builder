# Foxhound build script

For easier setups of Foxhound + Playwright.

Assume you have a folder structure like this:

`BASE_DIR/foxhound_builder <- this repo`

After running this script it will clone and setup foxhound and playwright inside the `BASE_DIR`. It should not require user interaction, unless some system dependencies are amiss.

## Usage

1. Create a folder for your project, put this project inside
2. `bash build.sh` and get a coffee
